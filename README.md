# PlayerBiomes
 Find player's biome using a PlaceholderAPI placeholder
 What does it do different than the other PlaceholderAPI expansions?
 It gives you the exact same name that the client sees which means it supports custom biomes (plugin and datapack)

(this is my first plugin so pls no hate, thanks @mfnalex for helping with this plugin :P)
